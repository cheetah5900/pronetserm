# Cftoys shop project

## Background
This project is Mobile Internet Top-up in Thailand. In 2018, I want to sale Mobile Internet Top-up to get commission from those selling. And there is no good website to do about Mobile Internet Top-up like me.

I decide to create this website and make it more simple and usable. This website is available at: https://pronetserm.com

In that time my languages skill are **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS** and little **Javascript** languages.
